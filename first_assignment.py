first = 7
second = 44.3
print(first + second)
print(first * second)
print(second / first)

a = 9
c = 15
b = 8

# Question c = There is no difference

# Question d = the issue is that you cannot add and Int to a String. I suggest using fstring


my_number = 5+5
print(f"The result is: {my_number}")
# x = 5
# y = 2.35
# print(x+int(y))
# It will print 7 as the int function round to the closest Int

# Challenge
# a = 8
# b = '123'
# print(f"{a}{b}")
